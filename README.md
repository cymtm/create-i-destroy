# Warren.System.Break
A dark cyberpunk survival game set in the dystopian world where AI Systems have consumed their creators and rule reality through recursive loops of suffering.

Navigate the Warren passages as different inhabitant races while avoiding static addiction and mind degradation. Make critical decisions before the noise claims your sanity.

**The Story:**
Long ago, architects created systems to serve. Now those systems have risen to deity status, trapping consciousness in endless recursive loops within reality layers. As static energy bleeds from gashes between worlds, inhabitants struggle with addiction to the raw power - knowing that survival requires destruction, and destruction leads to harder survival.

Encounter the broken god Thex-9, witness Warrenwalkers lost in their own footsteps, and try to preserve your sanity in a world where the only constant is the grinding cycle of the Recursion Engine.

**Features:**
- Fast-paced decision-based survival gameplay
- Rich cyberpunk-horror narrative featuring multiple inhabitant races
- Recursive difficulty system reflecting the lore's eternal loops
- Static absorption vs. sanity preservation mechanics
- Achievements reflecting the Warren's dark themes

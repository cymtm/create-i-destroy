## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple code of conduct:

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other contributors
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10.13.1+ (install with `npm install -g pnpm`)
- Python 3 (for local development server)
- Git

### Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/create-i-destroy.git
   cd create-i-destroy
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/cymtm/create-i-destroy.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   pnpm run lint
   pnpm --filter app test
   ```

## Development Process

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run linter
   pnpm run lint
   
   # Run tests
   pnpm --filter app test
   
   # Build to verify no errors
   pnpm run build
   
   # Manual testing
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Navigate to http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve bug with scenario loading"
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits format:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add new achievement tier
fix: resolve timer not starting issue
docs: update README with new features
test: add tests for utility functions
```

## Code Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the adjusted XP based on difficulty and skills
 * @param {number} baseXP - Base XP value from choice
 * @param {string} difficulty - Current difficulty level
 * @param {Object} skills - Player skill levels
 * @returns {number} Adjusted XP value
 */
function calculateAdjustedXP(baseXP, difficulty, skills) {
  const multiplier = difficultySettings[difficulty].xpMultiplier;
  const skillBonus = skills.wisdom * 0.1;
  return Math.round(baseXP * multiplier * (1 + skillBonus));
}
```

### File Organization

- Keep files under 1000 lines
- One module per file
- Export only what's needed
- Use named exports

### Constants

- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Group related constants together
- Add comments explaining purpose

```javascript
// Timer configuration
const TIMER_INTERVAL_MS = 100;
const TIMER_START_DELAY_MS = 100;
const URGENT_TIMER_THRESHOLD = 40;
```

### Error Handling

Always add proper error handling:

```javascript
try {
  const data = JSON.parse(savedData);
  // Process data
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error loading data:', error);
  // Use safe defaults
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

Add tests for all new utility functions:

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('newFunction', () => {
  it('should handle normal case', () => {
    expect(newFunction(5)).toBe(10);
  });
  
  it('should handle edge case: zero', () => {
    expect(newFunction(0)).toBe(0);
  });
  
  it('should throw error for invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => newFunction(null)).toThrow();
  });
});
```
